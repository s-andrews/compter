INSTALLING COMPTER
------------------

Dependencies
------------

Perl
----
Compter is written in Perl so you'll need to have a perl 
installation to run it.  There's almost certainly one on
any unix system you want to run this on already, but you
can check by opening a shell and running:

perl -V 

If you don't have perl then you can install it through
your system's package managed (yum, apt-get etc)


Perl Modules
------------
Compter uses one non-core Perl module, which is the Cwd
module.  You can install this with:

perl -MCPAN -e 'install Cwd'

..if it's not installed already.


R language
----------
For the heatmap compter uses R to do the clustering and
drawing.  You will therefore need a valid R installation
to be able to use the full functionality of the program
(you can run it using --nograph if you don't have R but
you won't get the pretty picture).

R is available from http://cran.r-project.org


R packages
----------

Compter uses the pheatmap package in R to draw the heatmap.
You will need to install this to get the program to work.

To install pheatmap and any dependencies it requires simply
open an R session and run:

install.packages("pheatmap")


Installing compter
------------------

Until there is an official release of compter we recommend
installing by doing a checkout of the latest development
version:

git clone https://github.com/s-andrews/compter.git

You will then need to either add the compter install directory
into your path, or symlink (DON'T COPY) the compter program
into a directory already in your path.


Running the test data
---------------------

To check that compter is installed correctly and working, 
move into the "test" directory in the compter install and
run:

compter -background mouse -o test.txt high_seqs.fa low_seqs.fa

You should see output like:

Reading background from /bi/apps/compter/backgrounds/mouse.cmp
Processing high_seqs.fa
...
Processing low_seqs.fa
..
Drawing heatmap

..and you should create output files:

test.txt and test.png


Problems, Bugs etc
------------------

If you have any problems with the program please report them in the issue
tracker on the github project page.  If you have any questions then please
send them to simon.andrews@babraham.ac.uk
